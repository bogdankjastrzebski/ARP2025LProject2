The project consists of two parts.

Part 1. Create your own R package and share it via GitHub. The package
should include:

- minimum three functions (you can use functions from Project 1),
- including at least one that uses other packages,
- at least one data set (can be synthetic),
- proper documentation of the functions and the data set should be
  included.

Part 2. Write a `*.Rmd` script that generates a PDF or HTML document
that provides instructions on how to use your package. The document
should contain:

- headings of different sizes (minimum two),
- at least three chunks,
- a list,
- a hyperlink,
- a plot,
- and a table.
